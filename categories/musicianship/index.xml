      <description>Continuing from part 1 of Rhythm in Hex.
THE TRIPLETS Done with the 4-note patterns, we can apply the same principle to the triplets as well, limiting to only 8 patterns in total, named: 0, 1, 2, 3, A, B, C, F. Can you guess which pattern each symbol represents?

Let&amp;rsquo;s review them in a list:
   4-note 3-Note Name       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     A     B     C     D     E     F    I&amp;rsquo;m sure all of you are thoughtful enough to realize the following problem: How do we distinguish the difference between 4-note pattern and 3-note pattern if they share the same name?</description>

      <description>Observation I&amp;rsquo;ve always been unfond of the typical academic rhythmic teachings around the world. Yes they do provide indepth explaination of rhythms in both macroscopic and microscopic level, however they lack a quick solution for the students that haven&amp;rsquo;t spent months or years of training in rhythm playing. Some twenty years ago in the western world, children are taught musicianship at a very early age, and with musical influence from the family and some spare practising time, they can get quite advanced in musical learning.</description>
