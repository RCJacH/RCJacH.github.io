The learning environment for music composition has a funny situation.
Instead of acquiring knowledge and skills as the building blocks of one's musical ability with a systematic approach, there are people that wish to believe in uncontrolled inspiration from unrelated stimuli.
Perhaps to prove that they are one of the musical geniuses, who receives direct injection of insight from some unknown spiritual forces, like those child prodigies constantly being aggrandized by the media since Mozart's time.

Make sense, how else can you make a living within any artistic discipline unless you are a child prodigy right?

But we often forget, or choose to neglect, the traumatizing trainings Mozart had to go through in his childhood.
That might be the most straightforward path to Rome, but the least exciting or newsworthy one.

I'm no journalist, and I have no interest to amuse myself with artificially manipulated information that does not grant me any benefit.
So my choice lies in the systematic studying of note relationship in both time and space.

That sounds like a tongue twister, let me rephrase it in plain English.

I believe the most fundamental skill in musical composition of any kind, from song writing to full orchestral arrangement, is the technique an **counterpoint**.

## What is Counterpoint

In essence, **counterpoint is writing melodies**.

However, rather than focusing on the melodic structure from short fragments, counterpoint focuses on the horizontal and vertical relationship, with note as its unit of measurement.
For each set of notes, we measure the degree of tension between each note, estimate the tolerance of dissonance at the time of occurrence, then choose the where each note moves to.
This creates a new set of notes, so we repeat the process of evaluation above.

Oops, did I just describe the art of voice leading in the jazz world?

That's the same idea with more advanced harmonic progressions.

We think of chords not only as a vertical blocks of notes, but also as separated horizontal lines.
Just by doing this, we create sense of direction where each note of a chord moves to a note from the next.
And with direction comes origin, destination, and thus purpose, then with purpose comes expectation, and expectation, well, it's what composition is all about.

## What is the pre-requisite for learning counterpoint

You need to learn the rudiments of music theory, pitch names, accidentals, intervals, the major scale formula, and note values (length).
Each concept takes less than a day to learn, with a good teacher and a good material, then spend as much time practicing as possible, so it becomes your second nature, like addition and subtraction in math.

We will be doing a lot of exercises to learn counterpoint, each exercise has at least 10 notes, and we usually have to do multiple passes to complete each exercise.
Therefore if we spend a minute for each note counting semitones, it will take 10 minutes just to do one pass, and likely hours just to finish one exercise correctly, which is very inefficient.

Reduce the reaction time for each concept down to less than 3 seconds, and if possible, 1.
Do so by listing notes of all 7 * 3 = 21 major scales by pitch name everyday for a month.
Start from major scales of root with no accidental, then those with sharpened and flattened roots.
It takes half an hour to write initially, 15 minutes after a week, around 10 after two weeks, and aim for 3 in a month.
That means list 7 scales per minute, so less than 10 seconds per scale, thus 1.5 seconds per note average.
Because we are writing all major scales, even with ones that have no practical meaning, such as Fb and B#, we are in reality preparing for everything that might happen in music.
There are also double sharps and double flats, but I believe once we get used to single sharps and flats, we are prepared for doubles and triples.

## I Am Prepared, How Do I Start Learning Counterpoint

We will be using a variation of species counterpoint.
Species counterpoint is just a fancy name for learning counterpoint with progressive difficulty, like a game campaign, starting with very defined and strict restrictions, unlocking new contents with each passing level, until we get to the final one with all resources, skills, and units available for deployment.

Also, if possible, use a keyboard, as in keyboard instrument.
Counterpoint was traditionally learnt by doing exercises with pen and paper, but my experience wasn't so great with that.
Not that it's harder to learn with pen and paper, in fact it's the opposite, learning with pen and paper make things easier, because it requires less mental imaging.

Using the keyboard forces you to think through much of the whole line before committing to it, it gives you aural and visual feedback immediately, which is one of the required conditions of deliberate practice.
It requires no keyboard technique, you only need to play one note per hand.

If that already sounds intimidating, don't worry, you are not even required to use two hands at the beginning.

We start with one note.

So when you are ready, let's begin.
