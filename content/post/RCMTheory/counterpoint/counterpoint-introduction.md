It's astonishing how many people consider composition, or most specifically, melody writing, as something unnurtured, something divine, something out of the world.
There may be some truth in that, as rare occasions of sudden insight without stimulus do happen.
However, relying on inspiration is definitely not an act of professionalism, especially when you have a deadline to catch.

Being professional is being reliable, meaning that you need to get work done with an acceptable standard even when your inspiration is sucked dry.
Reliability comes with ability.

Counterpoint is the trained skill of melody writing, a single melody or multiple layered ones.
It eventually grows into harmony, and coupled with structure design and motivic development, we are quite well equipped to enter the dungeon of composition.

There are two schools of teaching in counterpoint, but the fundamentals are the same.
We learn counterpoint by setting strict rules so we have to plan ahead, and the ability of planning is what distinguish professionals versus amateurs.
The rules we learn in counterpoint are not for actual production, they are only limitations to force us to learn to plan ahead.
Since music is such a personal thing, leaving complete freedom in our hands will give us no motivation to learn anything new.

This series will take the approach of species counterpoint, but the name doesn't matter.
Basically, we will learn counterpoint in progressive levels, where each level adds something new, from identical rhythm to free-writing, from two-part to three to four, which became the realm of linear harmony.
Also, with this approach, we start with the very basic but essential - one voice.
That's what a lot of tutorial miss out on.


We will be using the staff, that requires some rudiment music theory.
But hey, it's not hard, better brush up on it sooner than later.

Another thing to mention, rather than writing things out, I suggest playing the exercises on keyboard.
Yes.
Plan and play.
It requires you to plan out the whole exercise before playing, that's where the ability lies.
