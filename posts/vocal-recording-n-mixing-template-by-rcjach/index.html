All dynamic related FXs are designed to work around signals that are recorded with RMS level of -20dBFS.\nThere are four Screensets that are available through the Screenset/Layouts under View Menu. Each loads a different set of track views, serving four different purposes, listed below:\n Recording Lead Vocal Recording Vocal Harmony Mixing Lead Vocal Tracks without Harmony Tracks Mixing Lead Vocal Tracks with Harmony tracks  Also, on each vocal harmony group bus and the MMO tracks, there is one instance of ReaEQ labeled as DuckEQ. This FX is for automating EQ frequencies based on the loudness of the Lead Vocal, using parameter modulation, to avoid frequency clashing to a certain extend without compensating the overall tonal balance of the original track. However, feel free to bypass or delete this effect if you are using a more traditional approach.\nThe track Lead Vox and Backing Vox are for monitoring output levels on the mixer.\nFeel free to add more tracks for your creative purposes.\nListen to my A Capella song, A Quest for Vocal Harmony, composed and produced specifically for and with this template.\nHow to Use Preparation Place the GlobalSliders JS in the Effects folder and the project file in the ProjectTemplates folder, both under the REAPER Resources folder.\nCreate a new project using the Vocal Recording \u0026 Mixing Template by RCJacH template. Drag the instrumental audio file to the track labeled as “MMO”, and setup the audio interface and the input of both the VL Recording track and the VH Recording track.\nRecording Lead Vocal Load the first Screenset to record lead vocal tracks. Press Record Arm/Disarm on the VL Recording track, make sure that the VH Recording track is disarmed. Record takes in the VL Recording track, and then drag the recorded item to an appropriate track below, so we can unify recording levels and/or effects.\nRecording Vocal Harmonies Load the second screenset to record vocal harmonies. Press Record Arm/Disarm on the *VH Recording track, make sure that the VL Recording track is disarmed. Record takes in the VH Recording track, and then drag the recorded item to an appropriate track(s) below, so we can unify recording levels and/or effects.\nMixing Lead Vocal The Verse, Chorus, PC(Pre-Chorus)/Bridge tracks are used to ensure different items do not replace each other, so we can keep the breath prior to a phrase even when overlapping occurs. We can, of course, use these three tracks to treat different sections differently, by using different volume gain, FX, or sends. Some common treatment FX, with certain parameters modulated by track controls, are placed in the VL Final track. There are explanations for each FX in the FX comment, feel free to experiment or replace any or all of the FX.\nMixing Vocal Harmonies Use the EQ and HP controls on the mixer to remove muddiness, nasality, and rumbles of each track. Use the Compression control to either peak limit (FET-like) or even out the dynamic (OPTO-like) of the track. I cannot promise the simulation quality of the compressor (or any other effects), so again feel free to experiment or replace any or all of the FX. The Density control on the group bus is controlling the spread or individual panning of the sub tracks using a ReaDelay plugin, with different settings for different harmony groups. The Dim Mid control lowers the volume of tracks that are closer to the center of the panorama. You can adjust additional panning and volume freely with the track control.\nReverbs I tried to stick to the built-in effect for portability since not everyone has third-party plugins. Unfortunately, since the sound of ReaVerbate isn’t really as pretty as some of the more specified reverb plugins, I encourage you to replace the current chains with your favorite reverb plugin. TailVerb is likely a plate/hall reverb for creating thickness, while AirVerb is more of a room/hall type of reverb for creating the sense of space.\nChorus The Chorus track contains two modulated pitch shift effects to create chorus effects for the harmonies to thicken them up.\nTerminology MMO = Music Minus One, or instrumental track\nVL = Vocal Lead, including rap/spoken, and Ad Libs\nVH = Vocal Harmony, separated into three layers by their function and placement. The four capital letters following VH are arranged by their Placement, Function, Voicing, and Panorama.\nPlacement: C = VH Close are usually doubling of the melody, or parallel thirds/fourths, used to thicken/widen up the lead vocal.\nM = VH Mid are usually for call \u0026 response or riff kind of arrangements.\nF = VH Far are usually the sustained woos and ahs.\nAlthough they might not sound so different when recording, this way of organizing should provide you with a clue of what kind of harmony you might need.\nFunction: T = Thickener, normally a track with tighter rhythm but not as tight pitch deviation, placed closer to lead vocal.\nW = Widener, normally a track with tighter pitch but not necessarily tight rhythm, placed across the panorama.\nThese are used only as arrangement suggestions; you can also use them as additional voices of a harmony group.\nVoicing: H = Higher or top voice of the layer\nB = Bottom voice of the layer\nPanorama: L = Left\nR = Right\nNote that the panning of individual tracks is affected by the Density control on the group bus, usually spread across the panorama, with wideners more to the side and thickeners more to the center.\nDOWNLOAD Vocal Recording \u0026 Mixing Template by RCJacH ","wordCount":"982","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2016-04-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2016-04-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"RCJacH"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://RCJacH.github.io/posts/vocal-recording-n-mixing-template-by-rcjach/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"RCJacH","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://RCJacH.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><body class="l-viewFrame single" id=top><div class="l-viewGlass background"><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.c-theme_toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=l-header><nav class=l-nav><div class=c-logo><a href=https://RCJacH.github.io/ accesskey=h title="RCJacH (Alt + H)"><span class=c-logo__text>RCJacH</span></a>
