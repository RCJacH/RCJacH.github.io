However, ad blockers are restricted to web browsing, they are powerless against the pop-ups from the operating system. Of course, being a forgiving person that I am, closing them quietly without complain would be an expected reaction.
But perhaps the sheer number of programs installed, used, and maintained is too great in the modern digital world, or perhaps the rate of updates too frequent (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Adobe Flash Player), it has became a time-consuming chore just to deal with them every day.</description></item></channel></rss>
