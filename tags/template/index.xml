I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why you would want to set one up by comparing several different approaches to templating with large sample libraries.
To understand the benefits of having a dedicated server for sample libraries, we need to look at some of the problems composers are facing when producing music.
Problems when Working with Sample Libraries Problems with Sample Libraries The problem with sample libraries lies in the size of ensembles and time required to set them up for professional production.</description></item><item><title>REAPER Track Template - Layout RSGC</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/posts/reaper-track-template-layout-rsgc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/posts/reaper-track-template-layout-rsgc/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a Reaper Track Template that I believe would improve your production workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Layout RSGC&amp;rdquo;, which stands for Reference, Sections, Grooves, and Chords, a group of four tracks. These four tracks are used to construct a general layout for our song production, which is vital for commercial projects that is tight on schedule, with no time for any experimentation or trying out new ideas. It is way easier to insert the track template and copy n' pasting existing items rather than handwriting everything from scratch, which we may have been doing in the past.</description></item><item><title>Vocal Recording &amp; Mixing Template by RCJacH</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/posts/vocal-recording-n-mixing-template-by-rcjach/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/posts/vocal-recording-n-mixing-template-by-rcjach/</guid><description>Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template
By RCJacH
Explanation Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template by RCJacH is a REAPER template for recording and rough mixing lead vocal and vocal harmonies against an instrumental track, including native functional FXs (with a few JS effects) on each track with track controls directly visible on the mixer.
This template works the best with the default REAPER themes. All dynamic related FXs are designed to work around signals that are recorded with RMS level of -20dBFS.</description></item></channel></rss>
