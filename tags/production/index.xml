I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why you would want to set one up by comparing several different approaches to templating with large sample libraries.
To understand the benefits of having a dedicated server for sample libraries, we need to look at some of the problems composers are facing when producing music.
Problems when Working with Sample Libraries Problems with Sample Libraries The problem with sample libraries lies in the size of ensembles and time required to set them up for professional production.</description></item><item><title>REAPER - RCMShip Perfect Pitch</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/rcmship-perfect-pitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/rcmship-perfect-pitch/</guid><description>Download from here: RCMShip Perfect Pitch on Github

By RCJacH
Explanation Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template by RCJacH is a REAPER template for recording and rough mixing lead vocal and vocal harmonies against an instrumental track, including native functional FXs (with a few JS effects) on each track with track controls directly visible on the mixer.
This template works the best with the default REAPER themes. All dynamic related FXs are designed to work around signals that are recorded with RMS level of -20dBFS.</description></item></channel></rss>
