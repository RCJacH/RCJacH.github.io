      <title>How to REALLY Use the Metronome</title>

      <description>I was practicing keyboard one day with a metronome - the click-sounding machinery that&amp;rsquo;s been collecting dust on my shelf since purchase (I jest. I use software counterpart such as Bounce Metronome, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really collect dust when I never open it) - when lethargy struck. You know, the desire to withdraw from the current activity when it&amp;rsquo;s becoming repetitive and dull, or the urge to dawdle away upon facing difficult tasks.</description>

Ideology behind the 3NS System What is special about 3NS system comparing to the CAGED system or others? NOTE: this is mainly an explanation of the why behind this system, if you want to get to the actual learning process right away, skip the follow content and go directly to The Three Fundamental Finger Patterns.</description>

Introduction Scales, up and down the neck, although necessary for making conscious musical decisions, are often regarded as tedious chores that kills passion and desires for music making. How long have you been practicing or struggling with them, learning all the positions, memorizing the fingerings for each position, and managing your way through the mistakes?</description>

      <title>The Guitar Fretboard Exercise</title>
      <link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/the-guitar-fretboard-exercise/</link>

      <description>Recently I have realized that a very important piece of information in the guitar category was missing from this blog, and that is fretboard familiarity to its fundamental element - knowing the note names on the fretboard. It is so vital that I would say this is THE ability required to making music consciously on guitar. Thus I wish to share it with you!

I believe the origin of this exercise was from Joe Satriani&amp;rsquo;s Colume in GUITAR For The Practicing Musicians magazine, which was collected into a book called the Guitar Secrets.</description>

      <description>Introduction As guitarists, our exercises are filled with all kinds of diatonic and chromatic scales or chordscales, along with various techniques, licks, and comping methods. Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to present a very efficient and effective method of practicing scales, and that is the Single-String Scales. This is a great way to getting familiar with the fretboard scale-wise, breaking out of the old habit of staying within a single position, and thinking more musically.</description>
