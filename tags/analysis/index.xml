Before getting into the actual setup, let me first explain what they are and what they do.
The Purpose of Airwindows Console Plugins Airwindows Console series aim to emulate the summing effect of analog console systems.
Summing is what happens when two signals are combined. With digital signal, summing is simple addition.</description></item><item><title>Airwindows Console Plugins Comparison</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/aw-console-comparison/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 10:32:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/aw-console-comparison/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Airwindows Console series since it came out as free plugins.

From my understanding, the gospel-oriented scooping is a set of two chords, with step-wise motion voice-leadings, often in straight eighth or sixteenth notes.
I went through all transcription videos available on YouTube and found almost no scooping technique used for rhythmic heavy, ethereal, or folk-like songs. Jacob usually use scooping for expressive, soulful, down to earth kind of vocal effects.</description></item></channel></rss>
