It&amp;rsquo;s called LRC Maker, available in RCJacH&amp;rsquo;s ReaPack Repository.
I lied. The name is more explicit with searchable keywords, called RCJacH_Generate LRC Lyrics and Export to Clipboard.lua
If you dislike ReaPack, you can get the raw script here
The script combines the names of the active take of items on the selected track. Each item is considered as a separated line, with the starting location of the item as the timing of the line.</description></item><item><title>Cubehelix Color Palette Algorithm</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/color-cubehelix/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 14:42:02 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/color-cubehelix/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with generating color schemes with algorithms - using set of rules to calculate the most effective combination of colors - rather than manually selecting a handful based on personal preferences, which I have tried once or twice with no satisfying result. We&amp;rsquo;ll save the discussion of that for later. Today, I would like to share with you an algorithm called CUBEHELIX.
Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the traditional color schemes.</description></item><item><title>REAPER - RCMShip Perfect Pitch</title><link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/rcmship-perfect-pitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/rcmship-perfect-pitch/</guid><description>Download from here: RCMShip Perfect Pitch on Github
