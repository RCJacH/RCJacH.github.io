      <description>What is signal flow?
For our interest in digital audio production, signal flow is how signal data, either audio or MIDI, travel through various stages of the DAW calculation.
Because of the potential complexity of our routing, from something as simple as building a send track to something more abstract such as designing modular synth or multi-track template with parameter modulations, to have a clear mental picture of the signal flow, it would be quite beneficial to know what stages and in what order our signals are going through within the DAW.</description>

      <description>Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template
By RCJacH
Explanation 
Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template by RCJacH is a REAPER template for recording and rough mixing lead vocal and vocal harmonies against an instrumental track, including native functional FXs (with a few JS effects) on each track with track controls directly visible on the mixer.
This template works the best with the default REAPER themes. All dynamic related FXs are designed to work around signals that are recorded with RMS level of -20dBFS.</description>
