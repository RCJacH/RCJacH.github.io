      <description>I was practicing keyboard one day with a metronome - the click-sounding machinery that&amp;rsquo;s been collecting dust on my shelf since purchase (I jest. I use software counterpart such as Bounce Metronome, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really collect dust when I never open it) - when lethargy struck. You know, the desire to withdraw from the current activity when it&amp;rsquo;s becoming repetitive and dull, or the urge to dawdle away upon facing difficult tasks.</description>

      <title>An Elaborated Summary of the Technique of Gain-Staging - 1. What and Why</title>
      <link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/gain-staging/</link>

      <description>What is Gain-Staging Gain-staging is essentially the practice of managing all static volume settings with a fixed reference point. Static volume setting is decibels of gain added or subtracted to a signal at one place in the signal flow, which remains unchanged through out the time span of the project playback. The goal of gain-staging is to ensure that any pair of input and output signals enclosing a signal processor chain match in average volume.</description>

      <description>Definition Interval describes the relative distance in pitch between two musical notes.
Properties  An interval is always measured from the lower sounding note to the higher sounding note, regardless of their chronological sequence of appearance. Intervals have two properties: quantity and quality. When combined, quality appears before quantity. Quantity is the measurement of distance between the alphabet of the two comparing notes, starting with the starting note as 1, adding 1 for each different alphabet (octave sensitive) it goes through after landing on the targeting note.</description>

      <guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/rcmtheory/the-major-scale/</guid>
      <description>Definition The major scale is a selection of 7 notes within each frequency doubling based on a fixed relationship between each note, explained below.
Properties  The major scale has 7 scale degrees of different pitch classes, sorted by pitch, from lower to higher. Each scale degree has a specific name. There are two semitones that occur between the 3rd and the 4th scale degree, also between the 7th and the first 1st (8th) degree.</description>

      <description>Pitch Definition Pitch is the perceptual property of sound on a logarithmic frequency scale, it is the quality that permits the judgement of a sound being higher or lower.
Naming Scheme  There are 7 repeating groups of pitches, called Pitch Classes, labeled using alphabets A B C D E F G. However, there are total of twelve different pitches within each repetition, meaning that there are (12 - 7 = ) five pitches per repetition that does not directly land on an alphabet.</description>

      <description>Introduction Get ready for a &amp;ldquo;paradigm shift&amp;rdquo; from THE leader of this blog. No I&amp;rsquo;m not releasing an analog hardware synth, the paradigm I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is that I will be posting series of tutorials on music theory - rudiments, harmony, and perhaps counterpoint. This article will serve as an introduction and table of content to the series, and hopefully will be updated frequently (including chapter numbers). Before that, allow me to explain why I decided to spend the time to write on these topics that are already fully covered in almost all of the theory books and blogs available.</description>

      <guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/reaper-signal-flow/</guid>
      <description>What is signal flow?
For our interest in digital audio production, signal flow is how signal data, either audio or MIDI, travel through various stages of the DAW calculation.
Because of the potential complexity of our routing, from something as simple as building a send track to something more abstract such as designing modular synth or multi-track template with parameter modulations, to have a clear mental picture of the signal flow, it would be quite beneficial to know what stages and in what order our signals are going through within the DAW.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered an interesting and efficient way of using Reaper&amp;rsquo;s customizable toolbars.

In other DAWs, the toolbars would remain stagnant throughout the sessions, and the only change you can apply to them would be either to move them or hide them.
In Reaper, since we are lucky enough to have many customizable toolbars available, while able to customize our toolbars with any action, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long before our screen becomes like this</description>

      <title>Fundamental Guitar Voicings for Pian(o roll)ists</title>
      <link>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/fundamental-guitar-voicing-for-piano-rollists/</link>

      <description>For guitarist, from beginners to advanced players, there is a chord system called CAGED system, where you take the form of C, A, G, E, D barre chords and move them across the fretboard over different roots.
(img from http://www.cagedguitarsystem.net/)
So you only need to learn at most 5 basic chord shapes to start playing chord progressions on the guitar. However, for pianists, this concept might be a bit difficult to understand without basic guitar knowledge, and learning the guitar for a short time isn&amp;rsquo;t always the most efficient and effective method of approach to arranging for chordal playing on guitar.</description>

      <guid>https://RCJacH.github.io/blog/reaper-track-template-layout-rsgc/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a Reaper Track Template that I believe would improve your production workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Layout RSGC&amp;rdquo;, which stands for Reference, Sections, Grooves, and Chords, a group of four tracks. These four tracks are used to construct a general layout for our song production, which is vital for commercial projects that is tight on schedule, with no time for any experimentation or trying out new ideas. It is way easier to insert the track template and copy n&amp;rsquo; pasting existing items rather than handwriting everything from scratch, which we may have been doing in the past.</description>

      <description>Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template
By RCJacH
Explanation 
Vocal Recording &amp;amp; Mixing Template by RCJacH is a REAPER template for recording and rough mixing lead vocal and vocal harmonies against an instrumental track, including native functional FXs (with a few JS effects) on each track with track controls directly visible on the mixer.
This template works the best with the default REAPER themes. All dynamic related FXs are designed to work around signals that are recorded with RMS level of -20dBFS.</description>

      <description>When we are dealing with MIDI drumset, guitar, and other sample libraries that requires either multiple output or routing, the default setup may show up like this:
See the lines of space below the topmost track? That&amp;rsquo;s all the microphone outputs of a drum library. They display no audio information other than level meters, but taking up a huge chunk of space in the arranger view, especially when zoomed in. It will fire up your frustration during your working sessions, taking up scrolling time which you could have saved for music making, so we are better off throwing them out of our sight.</description>

      <title>Recording Volume Calibration</title>

      <description>I have seen many people, from amateurs to professionals (in China), myself included, struggling with digital volume level calibration while tracking. Many people do not bother having a standard with levels and many lack the understanding of impact of leveling in tracking, resulting in level inconsistency between tracks or even takes. It took me quite a while to come across articles explaining at what level we should be recording at and why, and thus helped me greatly by providing recordings at consistent level while removing any doubts of &amp;ldquo;am I recording too hot or too quiet?</description>

Introduction Scales, up and down the neck, although necessary for making conscious musical decisions, are often regarded as tedious chores that kills passion and desires for music making. How long have you been practicing or struggling with them, learning all the positions, memorizing the fingerings for each position, and managing your way through the mistakes?</description>

      <description>Recently I have realized that a very important piece of information in the guitar category was missing from this blog, and that is fretboard familiarity to its fundamental element - knowing the note names on the fretboard. It is so vital that I would say this is THE ability required to making music consciously on guitar. Thus I wish to share it with you!

I believe the origin of this exercise was from Joe Satriani&amp;rsquo;s Colume in GUITAR For The Practicing Musicians magazine, which was collected into a book called the Guitar Secrets.</description>

      <description>Introduction As guitarists, our exercises are filled with all kinds of diatonic and chromatic scales or chordscales, along with various techniques, licks, and comping methods. Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to present a very efficient and effective method of practicing scales, and that is the Single-String Scales. This is a great way to getting familiar with the fretboard scale-wise, breaking out of the old habit of staying within a single position, and thinking more musically.</description>

      <description>When singing melodic ideas, it is uncommon for most music enthusiasts to get familiar with note names, C D E and such, since we will eventually face the problem of requiring to sing a two-syllable note name (C Sharp or G Flat) under one note. What is more doable (pun intended) is to use a solfège or a solmization system to have a single syllable assigned to each note.</description>

      <description>Continuing from part 1 of Rhythm in Hex.
THE TRIPLETS Done with the 4-note patterns, we can apply the same principle to the triplets as well, limiting to only 8 patterns in total, named: 0, 1, 2, 3, A, B, C, F. Can you guess which pattern each symbol represents?

Let&amp;rsquo;s review them in a list:
   4-note 3-Note Name       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     A     B     C     D     E     F    I&amp;rsquo;m sure all of you are thoughtful enough to realize the following problem: How do we distinguish the difference between 4-note pattern and 3-note pattern if they share the same name?</description>

      <description>Observation I&amp;rsquo;ve always been unfond of the typical academic rhythmic teachings around the world. Yes they do provide indepth explaination of rhythms in both macroscopic and microscopic level, however they lack a quick solution for the students that haven&amp;rsquo;t spent months or years of training in rhythm playing. Some twenty years ago in the western world, children are taught musicianship at a very early age, and with musical influence from the family and some spare practising time, they can get quite advanced in musical learning.</description>

      <description>For the test project which code explained in the last post, I have been doing midi mock ups of guitar strumming patterns, matching up the velocity, speed, and range to the audio files to get a sense of humanization. From the analysis and past guitar playing experiences, here are few tips on guitar strumming.
 When strumming, most proficient guitarist work with subtractive method. Instead of counting where to strum, they have their hands moving up and down on the most active subdivisions and simply float over the strings without touching them when not strumming.</description>

Yes, github, no ads, fast connection, and customizeable.</description>
