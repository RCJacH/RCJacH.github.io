# Welcome to RCJacH's personal website
This is the source of [RCJacH.github.io](http://RCJacH.github.io/), where I am updating my profile, playlist, and music production blog.

This website does not contain any open source license. You can take ideas and snippets as you like, but pushing out clones of my personal blog isn't something I would like to see.

## Credits
  + Built with [Hugo](gohugo.io)
  + Built upon [Hugo Icarus theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-icarus/)
  + Uses [Vextab]() occasionally for displaying notation and/or guitar tablature.
  + Comment system built using [staticman](https://staticman.net)
  + Fonts are currently *Helvetica Neue* and *Microsoft Yahei*.

The website is currently partially bi-lingual in English and Chinese. However, only few articles were written in both languages. I will try to catch up with translation when time allows me to.
